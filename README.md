# AntForce

**AntForce** is a set of [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org) tasks that help implementing Continuous Integration for Force.com projects. It's built on top of [Force.com Migration Tool](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.daas.meta/daas) and extend it in many ways.

## Features

- deploy with reports
    - precise code coverage calculation
        - AntForce overcomes the issue of Metadata API which doesn't return coverage data for classes that don't have any tests
    - wildcards support for test classes
    - multiple types of reports: 
        - JUnit
        - Cobertura
        - HTML coverage report with or without code highlighting
- execute anonymous Apex code
- (un)install managed packages
- integration with build servers: Jenkins, TeamCity, TFS, Visual Studio Team System
- ability to use in parallel with Force.com Migration Tool in same build script

## Requirements

- JDK 1.8+
- Ant 1.9.7+

## Delivery

AntForce delivered through [Bintray](https://bintray.com/valmaev/maven/antforce/_latestVersion). It means that:

- you don't need to store any build-related .jar-files inside your repo! 
- you can use dependency manager such as [Apache Ivy](https://ant.apache.org/ivy) to download AntForce right in process of your projects's build.
